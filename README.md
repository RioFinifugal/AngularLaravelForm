This is a web application built with Laravel and Angular that allows you to create, view, edit, and delete datasets using a form. It also features a dark mode toggle for the user's convenience.

When the user inputs a number with decimal values, the form will display a warning message, reminding the user that the input should be a decimal number.

If a user tries to submit the form without inputting anything, the form will display a warning message, reminding the user to fill in all the required fields.

The application features a dark mode toggle, making it easier on the user's eyes when working in a low-light environment.

When the user inputs all the required information, they can save the form, and the new dataset will be displayed in an HTML table.

The user can edit or delete any dataset by selecting the corresponding buttons. When the edit button is clicked, the form will display the selected dataset's information, which the user can then modify and save. Similarly, when the delete button is clicked, the application will delete the selected dataset.
